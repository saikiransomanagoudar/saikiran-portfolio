        I'm a software engineer with over 4 years of experience building reliable, scalable web applications with a strong focus on full-stack and frontend development. I began my career at Wipro, where I grew into a Senior Software Engineer role with a strong focus on building responsive, user-friendly frontend applications for enterprise-scale systems. More recently, I completed my Master’s in Computer Science at the Illinois Institute of Technology and continued sharpening my full-stack skills through a fellowship at Headstarter.
        At Headstarter, I led a team in delivering multiple full-stack web applications using Agile (Scrum) practices. I developed AI-driven features using Next.js and the OpenAI API, integrated real-time capabilities with Firebase, and implemented Stripe for secure transactions—resulting in notable gains in performance, accuracy, and user engagement. This experience allowed me to work across the stack, combining clean UI development with scalable backend services and deployment pipelines.
        My technical toolkit includes JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, and Python, and I’ve worked with frameworks like Next.js, Node.js, Flask, and Spring Boot. I’m also experienced with tools like Docker, Kubernetes, and AWS, and familiar with databases such as MySQL, MongoDB, and Firebase.
        I care deeply about creating intuitive user experiences, writing maintainable code, and delivering software that’s both reliable and efficient. I enjoy collaborating in cross-functional teams, continuously improving developer workflows, and solving real-world problems through thoughtful engineering and design.
